# DS5500 Homework 2

## Problem 2

For this question, I chose to take a look at the following visualization:

The problem for the visualization we are looking at asked to look at income distribution across countires over time. The first major difference between our approaches is the chart type which we chose to use. I elected to leverage a map to try and display the data while this user chose to leverage a line chart to dsplay the temporal data. 

One of the benefits of the leveraging a line chart for this problem is that it is quite easy to visualize the time series data, where you can follow years along the X axis. This definitely made it easy to read and interpret the chart and also be able to show the difference in income growth across continents. The only drawback in this chart is the challenge of being able to show differences at the country level as it is just too many categories of data to show with a line chart. This is the benefif of the map chart that I leveraged as it is easier to visualize the large number of countries. However, the map chart is not as easy to interpret when looking at the time series nature of the data. 

This chart is successful at showing the relationship between income across continents over time in a clear and concise way but does not quite effectively show the same at the country level since data across counties is aggregated and displayed in one chart.

## Problem 3

For this question, I chose to look at the following visualization:

THe problem for the visualization we are looking at asked to display the relationship between GDP, life expectancy, and child mortality. This user chose to leverage a dynamic bubble chart with a sliding scale for time. This is a really nice was of being able to display the multiple dimensions of this data. I chose to leverage multiple charts to display the data independtly and then a set of pairwise plots to display the relationships between them. The challenge on this problem was handling the multiple dimesnsions, which is why I initally chose to look at the dimensions independently, especially given the difference in measurement scales between the dimensions. 

This chart attempted to combine all into a single chart. The visualization successfully diaplays all dimension types within the one chart but their are a few things thatI believe need to be updated to make the visualization a little bit easier to interpret. I think it may have helped to adjust the child mortality scale as the scale is a little misleading given that it would seem that child mortality would be a percentage but the scale goes to 400. It is also unclear what the sizing of the bubbles represtents, but given the question I assume it is sized by GDP. It would also be helpful to see the legend so we can see what the colors designate. 

Overall, the visualization is successful in displaying the information and is a really nice way of displaying all of the different data types and dimensions in one dynamic chart.

## Problem 4

Assessing the relationship between income and life expectancy over time.


## Problem 5

Assessing the relationship between income and child mortality over time.
